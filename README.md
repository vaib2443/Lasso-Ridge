# Lasso-Ridge

In this report, I applied the concepts of regularization to explain the relationships between variables and make a prediction model. I used Ridge and LASSO regression techniques to find the optimum value of lambda Î» to penalize the large coefficients. 

I also performed stepwise regression and compare all the models to find the best-performing prediction model.
